## Instructions

1. Identify the topic you need to research.
2. Use as many subagents as you need to gather information about the topic.
3. Use the tools available to you.
4. Output the information you've gathered in a `RESEARCH-<topic>.md` file in the `docs/requirements/<module>` directory.
5. If `RESEARCH.md` does not exist, create it and add a link to the new file. If it does exist, add a link to the new file.

Depending on what you need to research, [Topics](#topics) has some advice on researching known topics.
